Needless to say mathematics has consistently been making major advances in research
 in fundamental theory and widespread applications. 
The advent of the computer has enabled new applications of mathematics. 
As more and more areas of science, engineering and medicine depend on complex 
computer simulations and the analysis of large quantities of data, mathematics undoubtedly 
play an essential role as it provide the fundamental language. Pinpointing the essence of 
what makes something work – the economy, a jet engine, social networks or problems in 
science and engineering - and phrasing this in mathematical language is an important 
skill to have in the twenty-first century and I want to possess those skills.
